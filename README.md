# codecademy
Location for all school projects

Hello everyone!

My name is Brandon, Im 38 and living back in hometown after a 9 yr stint in New Orleans.  Spent my time learning about myself and what I am truly passionate about.  I found out that I enjoy designing and building websites.  I also realized that I need to learn coding to keep up with the changing times.  That is the reason for starting this class.  I will have a busy 2 months but it will be well worth it.
